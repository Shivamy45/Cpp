Containers in STL

1. Sequence containers - linear fashion - linear structure
                Random Access   Middle Insertion|Del    Insertion at the end
    -> vector - fast            slow                    fast
    -> list -   slow            fast                    fast
    -> dequeue
2. Associative containers - direct access - tree structure - all operation fast execpt RA
    -> Map
    -> Multi Map
    -> Set
    -> Multi Set
3. Derived containers - real world modelling - operation depends -> learn in DSA
    -> queue --> FIFO - first in first out
    -> stack --> LIFO - last in first out
    -> priority queue
